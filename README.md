# migrate-actions tool

Converts GitHub Actions `main.workflow` files into the new `.yml` syntax. **Note:** using this tool doesn't affect your ability to use the new YAML syntax, wait until you hear from us before making the migration.

To report an issue not specifically related to this CLI tool (e.g runtime issues, features you would like to see in GitHub Actions etc), please follow the [standard beta contact instructions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-actions#contacting-support).

## Install

Pre-built binaries are available for Linux, OSX and Windows, and it can be built for any environment that Go supports. Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/actions/migrate/releases) tab, and download the archive for your operating system:

- Windows: migrate-actions-windows.zip
- Linux: migrate-actions-linux.tar
- OSX: migrate-actions-osx.tar

and unarchive it.

Alternatively you can do the same with docker as well. Use the following command.
```
docker run --rm -it -v /path/to/cloned/repository:/migrate/  dhsathiya/migrate:v1
```

## Usage

Once you've downloaded and unarchived the tool, navigate to a repository using Actions via a `main.workflow` file and run the `migrate-actions` executable (`migrate-actions.exe` on windows) without any arguments,
locating the executable by its full path, e.g `~/Downloads/migrate-actions-osx/migrate-actions` on OSX.

Given an existing `.github/main.workflow`:

```hcl
workflow "on push" {
    on = "push"
    resolves = ["say hi"]
}
workflow "on pull request" {
    on = "pull_request"
    resolves = ["say hi"]
}
action "say hi" {
    uses = "docker/whalesay@master"
    runs = "cowsay hello actions"
}
```

Running `migrate-actions`:

```
Created workflow .github/workflows/push.yml
Created workflow .github/workflows/pull_request.yml
```

This will produce two GitHub Actions V2 YAML configuration files.
First, it will produce a configuration for pull requests, `.github/workflows/pull_request.yml`:

```yaml
on: pull_request
name: on pull request
jobs:
  sayHi:
    name: say hi
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    - name: say hi
      uses: docker/whalesay@master
      with:
        entrypoint: cowsay
        args: hello actions
```

Next, it will produce a configuration file for pushes, `.github/workflows/push.yml`:

```yaml
on: push
name: on push
jobs:
  sayHi:
    name: say hi
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    - name: say hi
      uses: docker/whalesay@master
      with:
        entrypoint: cowsay
        args: hello actions
```

You can then delete your `main.workflow`. If you have any `.yml` files in `.github/workflows` your `main.workflow` will be ignored.

## Limitations

- Comments are dropped, sorry! 😭
- Parallel workflows are serialized (see Conversion notes)

## Conversion notes

The original beta version of Actions supported parallel Action execution while sharing a workspace. In V2, we do support parallel execution of jobs, but jobs do not share workspaces.

This means parallel workflows will be linearized:

```
      ┌───────┐             ┌───────┐
      │   A   │             │   A   │
      └───────┘             └───────┘
          │                     │    
    ┌─────┴─────┐               ▼    
    │           │           ┌───────┐
    ▼           ▼           │   C   │
┌───────┐   ┌───────┐       └───────┘
│   B   │   │   C   │           │    
└───────┘   └───────┘           ▼    
    │           │           ┌───────┐
    └─────┬─────┘           │   B   │
          ▼                 └───────┘
      ┌───────┐                 │    
      │   D   │                 ▼    
      └───────┘             ┌───────┐
          │                 │   D   │
    ┌─────┴─────┐           └───────┘
    │           │               │    
    ▼           ▼               ▼    
┌───────┐   ┌───────┐       ┌───────┐
│   E   │   │   F   │       │   F   │
└───────┘   └───────┘       └───────┘
                                │    
                                ▼    
                            ┌───────┐
                            │   E   │
                            └───────┘
```

Since `jobs` can be parallel, if there isn't a hard dependency on shared workspaces, you can regain paralleism by duplicating work. For instance, we can make E and F run in parallel by creating two jobs, both linearizing the dependencies leading up to the final action:

<table>
      <tr>
            <th>Workflow file</th>
            <th>Resulting build</th>
      </tr>
      <tr> 
           <td>
           
```
on: push
jobs:
  E:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - run: ./A
    - run: ./B
    - run: ./C
    - run: ./D
    - run: ./E
  F:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - run: ./A
    - run: ./B
    - run: ./C
    - run: ./D
    - run: ./F
```
